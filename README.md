# voting-at-McGill
Voting system for personnel at McGill

# general description
Voting-at-McGill allows for students and McGill personnel to create votes on the Ethereum Network. The contract is built on the Ropsten Test Network, and supports both petitions and elections. Users must have a McGill email in order to participate. Because the application is decentralized, no organization has the right to interfere with the contract.

# how to run
Because of complications with the Web3 network, the website is not deployed. Therefore, in order to run the application, do the following after cloing the repository and navigating into Voting-at-McGill/client:

    npm run dev
This should boot up the application on localhost:3000, and allow users to access a common application.
